## Bagel ## just playing with ideas
#
# bag based programming language (vs, stack)
# bag vs. stack --- it picks the first propper object (should be fully deterministic) from bag vs. the top item on stack 
#
# inspired by factor, rebol ...
#
# stack languages are ideal clear minimalistic programming languages, if you forget about stack shuffling words which are pure noise 
# (they tell you nothing about what you are doing (the intent), but making sure the code works)
#
# we avoid stack words by this BAG idea, with a lot of contexts (complex combinations of values go into context -- even local/temporary contexts)
# by (guards with leaks (probably bad name)..) and at last with stack expressions ab|ba swap , a|aa dup, abc|cab ... which are visual, not mostly "historical"
#

# here we define contexts

person: name surname age city!location      	     	  # we want the least amount of noice so two newlines separate contexes, functions

city: name country!country lat long			  # city!location determines a value of city! context/type..

country: name

#here we define functions (pure and unpure)		# functions should have few lines at max (as per factor)

birthday@ (person!)								# takes and returns person!
	  age> 1 + >age

present# (person!)
	 "Hi, I am " name> join print

present# (city!)
	 name> " from " city> name> join3 print					# name> here takes from the first propper context it finds on stack (which is city)

locate@ (person! city! -- person!)  	  					# takes 2 types of objects and returns one
	>city

where-from# (person!)								# separate pure functions from functions with effects
	    >city present



# how could we create context with (linked contexts in toplevel), without temp state

person! 30 >age "jim" >name ( city! "Ljublana" >name ( country! "Slovenia" >name .) >country .) >country where-from		 

	   	      	      	    	       	       			   	# ( preserves the stack it got and potentially leaks objects with . )


make-person@ (age name city country -- person!)
	     abcd|dcba  #stack expression idea
	     person! >age >name ( city! >name ( country! >name .) >country .) >city


#without stack expression

make-person@ (age name city country -- person!)					
	     person! ( city! ( country! >name .) >country >name .) >city >name >age



# it would make sense that it finds a city if there already is one in some global scope links to it, otherwise create new one
# this function creates a person, if there is already a city with that name it links it to it, otherwise creates a city and stores it in some global context
# the same with country, if it creates a city it tries to link it with existing country, otherwise creates it and stores it in some global context


make-person@ (age name city country -- person!)					
	     person! ( [ :city find-city | city! ( [ :country get-country | country! >name ( store-country ) ] any .) >country >name ( store-country ) ] any .) >city >name >age


# [ ] is a quotation in this cade or a block that is tried to be executed as code
# [ | ] is a series of quotations [ [ ] [ ] ]
# any functions similar as REBOL's any
# ( ) preserve the stack, we want to store that thing without even thinking of fucking anything up there
# :<name> retrieves a object by stack effect name (we could have second and first there, but it just makes less obvious code without any benefit except feeling the stack glory
# person! city! puts an empty context on stack


# can we determine types with names?

make-person@ (number!age string!name city!city country!country -- person!)
	     person! ( [ :city find-city | city! ( [ :country get-country | country! >name ( store-country ) ] any .) >country >name ( store-country ) ] any .) >city >name >age

# since here all types are different we wouldn't have to worry about stack order any more?
# >value takes the value but keeps the context on stack , we should have similar method that keeps the value on stack .>value ?

# of course we will need conditionals and loops etc which are made as in REBOL and Factor out of blocks/quotations and orditary functions

list-users# ([person!])
	    [ name> newline join print ] foreach

norm-name@ (string!name)
	    empty? [ "sir" ] [ name uppercase ] either



# of course better would be 

list-users@ ([person!])						# how do we define series of types?? do we ?? can me make context unions, ...
	    "" [ name> newline join ] reduce


# where reduce could be defined something like this

reduce@ (series start quot!q(acc x -- acc) -- result )		# can types like quotations have stack effect definitions too??????
	:series [ q do ] foreach




# all things are basically blocks and transformation should be very! simple, all is basically just context sugar (or context clearing out)

birthday@ (person!)
	  age> 1 + >age

==>

birthday: bagfunc [ person! ] [ age> 1 + >age ]

==>

setword word(native func) [ ctxword ] [ coword number word ciword ]  # coword context-out , ciword context-in


# so if we make parser interpreter we should make it for this, block code
